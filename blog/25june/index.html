    <p>
        I've been looking back at my old scratch games and I used to make so much stuff, but now I feel like I haven't been doing enough. <br>
        So I'm going to start forcing myself to work on smaller scale games and only spend like a few days max on each project. <br>
        To help with this I have started using the Phaser Javascript framework. I don't know that much about it, but I'll see if it sticks. <br><br>
        Right now I've made a simple frogger clone with Phaser. It was a little bit of a learning curve, but I'm starting to get Phaser. I'll put the game on this website soon I'm sure. <br>
        I have a few ideas for my next game, I've been thinking of recreating a puzzle game that I was playing on my phone. I thought it was an interesting idea that I have never seen before. <br><br>
        It's difficult to describe so just search up <i>Folding Blocks Puzzle</i>. <br>
        I've also been thinking about making some multiplayer games, since I like playing games with friends a lot :). I'm thinking either a 2 player coop puzzle platformer or some competitive pvp game. <br>
        Ok so goodbye until July or whenever I remember this.
