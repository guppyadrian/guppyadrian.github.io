    Rodrick Tries His Best
  </h>
  <p>
    This is a 2d platformer inspired by Celeste. It features this square named "Rodrick" who has to try his best to platform through obstacles or smthn.<br><br>

    This was a game I made in 9th grade (2022) with 3 other friends for a school project. The prompt was to "make an art piece inspired by Science Fiction or a forward thinking idea."<br>
    To make this game count as art, we pretty much copied the idea of Celeste where the mountain is a metaphor.<br>
    Idk how this game related at all to the prompt, but I'm pretty sure we got a good grade so idc.<br>
    I was the programmer, 1 friend did tile art, 1 friend did music, and 1 friend did background art.<br><br>

    This was a pretty fun project to do. This is like the only game I have made with a menu screen and it was the first time experimenting with CSS to make that button.<br>
    There are only 2 levels, but there was a third steampunk level planned. Music and bg art was made for it, but we didn't have enough time to actually finish it. To avoid showing that we didn't have a third level I just made level 2 much more difficult than level 1 so that no one could see we didn't make a third level.
