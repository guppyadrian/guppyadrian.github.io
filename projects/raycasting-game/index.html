    Raycasting Horror Game
  </h>
  <p>
    This is a horror maze game prototype that uses raycasting instead of true 3d. I followed Griffpatch's scratch tutorial and translated it to Javascript.<br><br>

    Originally it was just a raycasting game, but I remember talking with friends about the "dap me up" meme and what if there was a monster who just yelled "dap me up".<br>
    This then turned into a friend making a "dap me up monster" that I put into the game. It doesn't move at all though cause I lost motivation for the project.<br>
    Overall I think this is a technically impressive project, cause making a 3d game from scratch is actually pretty hard.<br>
    This is also one of my only projects utilizing audio.
