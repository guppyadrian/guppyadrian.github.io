    Patricks Parabox but JS
  </h>
  <p>
    This is a complete recreation of <i>Patricks Parabox</i> with the same levels as the original demo of the game.<br>
    This is my most impressive project in my opinion because of how complex the game logic is.<br><br>

    This was for a 9th grade project about convincing others of your opinion and have them donate "red bucks" to your cause.<br>
    Originally I was making a website talking about how bad mobile games were, but then I got bored and started coding Patricks Parabox,
    then I got so far into it I might as well make it my project.<br><br>
    So on presentation day the entire 9/10th grade classes were all together looking at projects and I titled mine "Infinity Is Hard".<br>
    Using Patricks Parabox, I would convince others that infinity was a really complex concept (which was just some BS reason so that I could use this game as my project)<br>
    I would have them bet red bucks to see if they could beat a few levels. But it was rigged cause the first few levels would introduce the idea of recursion, but then the final level dealt with a mechanic that wasn't introduced at all.<br>
    I also added the clone mechanic to the game, but didn't have any levels using it cause those were levels from the paid version of Patricks Parabox.
