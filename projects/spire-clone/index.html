    Slay The Spire Game
  </h>
  <p>
    This is a card battler (barely) about defeating enemies while managing sleep. This project was very obviously influenced by the fact this was for an assignment.<br>
    This uses assets from slay the spire and uses cards, but thats pretty much the only similarities.<br><br>

    This is a project I made for an english class in 10th grade. The prompt was to make something based off another student's essay we read.<br>
    The essay I read was about sleep deprivation, and I think I was procrastinating a lot on the project, so I just made this really quickly with only 2 different moves.<br>
    This is literally just slay the spire except "sleep" is your hp. Moves will use increasing amount of "sleep" to use.<br>
    So this is intended to be a metaphor of balancing sleep with your life.<br><br>

    I'm not really that proud of this project, but I do think that the animation with cards, and I liked the parallax effect.<br>
    I do think that I should come back to this and recreate Slay the Spire instead of what it is currently.<br>
    I looked through the code again and I saw that I was making support for multiple allies, and that I was planning on adding more than 2 cards.<br>
    Also the character is apparently named Jim according to the code.
