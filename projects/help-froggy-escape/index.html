    I'm trying out the Phaser Framework rn and this is my first game made with Phaser.<br>
    It's really scuffed. I might come back to this to add a score counter, and some other improvements.<br><br>

    I wanted to get back into programming, so I'm trying new stuff and I will work on making more smaller scale games.
