    Mind Ur Miners
  </h>
  <p>
    This is a prototype for an open world sokoban puzzle game. I ended up only making 1 level before moving on to a different idea.<br>
    Push boxes onto pressure plates to open up pathways.<br><br>


    This was almost made for a school project in 10th grade. We ended up moving to work on an RPG like game instead.<br>
    Me and a friend worked on this. He did the art and design for this.<br>
    So this is one of the only games I made with lore, albeit a very small amount. <br><br>

    There was a cavein that happened in a mining site, and now you have to save the miners by pushing around boulders onto pressure plates.<br>
    This was going to be an open world puzzle game, inspired by <i>The Witness</i> but after some talk with my group members, we thought making a more action focused project would be more appealing to the audience.<br>
    I do really think that this game could have been pretty cool. I think the 2.5d art style looks clean and I really like puzzle games.<br>
    Biggest challenge for this was dealing with the draw order with 2.5d, like how tiles have to appear in front of other tiles, and the other challenge was working with a player sliding animation, since this was my first time having to deal with having a delay between movement.
