    Inscryption Clone
  </h>
  <p>
    A simple js clone of Inscription (specifically act 3)<br>
    Game plays pretty much the same, but is really scuffed.<br><br>
    This was made back in 9th grade for an English class where I had to make a game using greek gods.<br>
    I thought it would be a good idea to use inscryption with renamed units so I made that. The tutorial is pretty half-assed since I realized way too late that I needed a tutorial, since the project was a gallery walk.<br>
    After this project was over, I renamed them all back to the normal inscryption units.
